# ðŸ’ª A Full Day Of Vue.js Workshop

## State Management & Vuex - Exercise (Starting Point)

### Goals

_Complete the below separately_:

* Use Custom Events to have the `InputComponent` manipulate the data value in the root `App` component. Use props to pass data from `App` to the `NoteCountComponent`.
* Create a simple store pattern that has `InputComponent` and `NoteCountComponent` interact through a single `store` instance.
* Create a Vuex store pattern to have `InputComponent` input information and `NoteCount` to determine the number of notes entered.
